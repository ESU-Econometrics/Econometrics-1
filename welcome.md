## I know selecting econometrics as a course couldn't have been easy. You may have asked yourself questions like:
1. What is econometrics anyhow?
2. How is it going to help me?

## The answer to the first question:
**Econometrics** is the statistical and mathematical methods used by economists to study economic phenomena. In a nutshell, econometricians have one of two jobs:
* Theorist: this person spends hours creating econometric models and proving theorems.
* Applied Econometrician: this person uses data and econometric models to test economic theory.

## The answer to the second question:
Studying econometrics will:
1. Provide you with statistical and mathematical toolkits for answering real-world questions
2. Make you think deeply about the world around yourself
3. Develop your analytical abilities
4. Enhance your understanding of programming as used by educators and economists (we will not be doing app development in this course)
